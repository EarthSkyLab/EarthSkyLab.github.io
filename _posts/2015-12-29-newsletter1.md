Friends! Amigos! Druzya! 


Welcome to EarthSkyLab Newsletter #1! This year EarthSkyLab took its first step into the world with the publishing of the vision document and opening of the facebook page. We are overjoyed with the number of people who have engaged with these ideas through questions, comments and discussion. We visited villages for sale in Portugal and connected with local guides. We have done our first public presentation at ‘7 of Clubs’ and received good feedback. Thank you for supporting us by subscribing and liking facebook page, please share and help the village grow! Also follow us on pinterest.

## EarthSkyLab Camp Aug/Sep 2016 (Portugal)
In 2016 we will create a month-long EarthSkyLab Camp - an opportunity to live together in community. A chance to develop the EarthSkyLab vision. An opportunity to plan for our individual escape-the-city journey and path towards an independent livelihood.

We will think, learn, cook and eat together, having fun, watching the stars, celebrating. We will practice mindfulness and share our practices. We learn natural building as we build a cob building to ensure a healthy balance  of head, heart and hands. We will share crafts and build a story of what EarthSkyLab life feels like.
The camp will be co-created together by all participants.


## Axis Mundi
This fall we launched Axis Mundi, a team for planning and visualization of the EarthSkyLab village architecture. Axis Mundi is a partnership with Mi5 Architects, Nacho Martin and Manu Collado and will continue until spring 2016. The result will be a comprehensive plan and a visualisation of the EarthSkyLab village. 
Let us know if you are interested in participating in developing the village building and infrastructure plan, the garden and food forest.

## Ideas for 2016

We have many plans for 2016 and hopes to introduce many more people to the EarthSkyLab idea:
* EarthSkyLab Camp 2016
* Regular EarthSkyLab online calls every 1-2 months.
* Vision v0.3 - do a revision of the vision document
* Launch a redesigned website.
* Initial Axis Mundi vision completed and circle open to new collaborators
* Start a “Reinventing-the-village/Teal village” working group to create a map of all the things which need to be planned, a general model of which EarthSkyLab will be one specific version.
